**CSS is hard**. Only standard CSS specs [have more than 240 CSS rules](https://css-tricks.com/how-many-css-properties-are-there/).
And we go over 300 if we count drafts and partial support in different browsers. But you don't need to remember all of them. With CSS
Intel, you have access to standard IDE CSS annotations.

## CSS Intel Features: 

- MDN live CSS rules documentation
- Inline RGB/RGBA/HSL/HEX colors token
- CSS variables resolution and navigation between files through Sourcegraph search.

This extension is still in experimental stage. Feel free to play with it and add something new.
